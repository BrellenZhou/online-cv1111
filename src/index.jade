          h2 Summary
          p.
            Data Scientist with full stack software development experience.
            I am a bit of a jack-of-all-trades -- having
            studied pure math at the University of Waterloo, spent time at
            large and small companies in a variety of development and data
            roles, and founded my own startup-turned-open-source-project
            Polychart.

          p.
            My proudest achievements are:
          ul
            li.
              Scoring 33 points on the Putnam math contest (where median score is 0 most years)
            li.
              Publishing on the Facebook data science blog.
            li.
              Writing three blog posts that made the front page of Hacker News.
            li.
              Founding a startup Polychart, taking it through 
              accelerator program Extreme Startups, meeting awesome people for
              a ride that culminated in an open source project
              and personal development.

          p.
            Favourite tools of mine include Python, R (with RStudio, ggplot2),
            coffeescript, vim, git, linear & logisitc regression, and Bayesian
            techniques.
